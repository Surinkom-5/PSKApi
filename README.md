## How do i use this

App uses swagger to see implemented endpoints and their documentation: http://localhost:57678/swagger/index.html

Before using the api you need to generate database.
To do that go to package manager console, select FlowerShop.Infrastructure as default project and use command:
```
PM> update-database
```
